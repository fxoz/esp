# HSNR Erstsemersterprojekt

The task of the first semester project was to build and program a robot that can be controlled remotely using a smartphone. On a playing field measuring approx. 3x3m, which is divided into two fields of equal size by a dividing line, 8 balls were placed on each field, which the ‚ÄúRoboCar‚Äù shoots into the opponent's field if possible, but preferably into the opponent's goal straight away.

Each team received a basic set of equipment consisting of a power bank, two motors and an ESP board, among other things. We then had to develop and implement a ball pick-up and shooting mechanism. We had to use the [RemoteXY App](https://remotexy.com/), and the Arduino platform for remote control.
